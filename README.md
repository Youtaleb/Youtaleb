- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Youtaleb\

After studying engineering in computer science and electronics as well as both fundamental and applied mathematics, my passion turned to applying mathematics and computer science to solve real life problems. Having a significant experience in coding, I am particularly interested in machine learning and software engineering.
